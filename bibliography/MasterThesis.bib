@article{Fadlun2000,
abstract = {A second-order accurate, highly efficient method is developed for simulating unsteady three-dimensional incompressible flows in complex geometries. This is achieved by using boundary body forces that allow the imposition of the boundary conditions on a given surface not coinciding with the computational grid. The governing equations, therefore, can be discretized and solved on a regular mesh thus retaining the advantages and the efficiency of the standard solution procedures. Two different forcings are tested showing that while the quality of the results is essentially the same in both cases, the efficiency of the calculation strongly depends on the particular expression. A major issue is the interpolation of the forcing over the grid that determines the accuracy of the scheme; this ranges from zeroth-order for the most commonly used interpolations up to second-order for an ad hoc velocity interpolation. The present scheme has been used to simulate several flows whose results have been validated by experiments and other results available in the literature. Finally in the last example we show the flow inside an IC piston/cylinder assembly at high Reynolds number; to our knowledge this is the first example in which the immersed boundary technique is applied to a full three-dimensional complex flow with moving boundaries and with a Reynolds number high enough to require a subgrid-scale turbulence model.},

@article{Rotvig2002,
abstract = {We present a fully 3D self-consistent convection-driven dynamo model with reference to the geodynamo. A relatively low Ekman number regime is reached, with the aim of investigating the dynamical behavior at low viscosity. This regime is computationally very demanding, which has prompted us to adopt a plane layer model with an inclined rotation vector, and to make use of efficiently parallelized code. No hyperdiffusion is used, all diffusive operators are in the classical form. Our model has infinite Prandtl number, a Rayleigh number that scales as E(-1/3) (E being the Ekman number), and a constant Roberts number. The optimized model allows us to study dynamos with Ekman numbers in the range [10(-5),10(-4)]. In this regime we find strong-field dynamos where the induced magnetic fields satisfy Taylor's constraint to good accuracy. The solutions are characterized by (i) a MAC balance within the bulk, i.e., Coriolis, pressure, Lorentz, and buoyancy forces are of comparable magnitude, while viscous forces are only significant in thin boundary layers, (ii) the Elsasser number is O(10), (iii) the strong magnetic fields cannot prevent small-scale structures from becoming dominant over the large-scale components, (iv) the Taylor-Proudman effect is detectable, (v) the Taylorization decreases as the Ekman number is lowered, and (vi) the ageostrophic velocity component makes up 80\% of the flow.},

@book{tritton88,
abstract = {This book presents the physics of incompressible flow for the benefit ofstudents and others who need to understand fluid motion. In this new edition,much of the material is new or rewritten, but the purpose and style of thefirst edition are retained. Particular emphasis is given to informationobtained by experiment and observation in addition to analysis of theequations of motion. The book's primary concern is to convey a fundamentalunderstanding of the behavior of fluids in motion. Special features include anintroductory non-mathematical treatment of three particular flowconfigurations; extensive consideration of geophysical topics; and detailedcoverage of topics that are known primarily through experimental data.Numerous photographs illustrate the phenomena discussed, and a concludingchapter demonstrates the wide applicability of fluid mechanics. New topics inthe second edition include double diffusive convection and modern ideas aboutdynamical chaos. The discussion of instabilities has been restructured and thetreatments of separation and of convection in horizontal layers considerablyexpanded.},
