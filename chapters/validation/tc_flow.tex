The setup of the Taylor-Couette flow test case is shown in Fig. \ref{validation:setup_tcflow}.
It contains of two coaxial cylinders which are oriented parallel to the z-axis.
The inner cylinder has a radius and angular velocity $r_i$ and $\Omega_i$, in analogy we define
$r_o$ and $\Omega_o$ for the outer cylinder.
The fluid domain is given by the gap of width $d = r_o - r_i$ between the cylinder and extends to infinite.
For the simulation  periodic boundaries are used in $z$-direction.

In constrast to the previously examined test cases this system provides different characteristics
of the flow regime at the immersed boundaries. The flow along the boundary is not orthogonal to the curvature of the geometry,
Furthermore the velocity at the boundarys is not zero, the boundarie needs to fullfill the Dirichlet condition, which is given by
$|\vec{v}(\vec{r})|_{r_i} | = |\Omega_i \times \vec{r}|$.

In dependency of the domain paratemers different flow regimes can occur.
For small differences in the rotation rate the flow is laminar and azimuthal.
An increase of the angular velocity of the inner cylinder leads to an instability.
In this flow regime toroidally vortices form, which are also denoted as Taylor cells,
the flow is not pure azimuthal \citep{tritton88}.
In this testcase only the laminar and azimuthal flow regime, where the outer cyinder is not rotating ($\Omega_o = 0$), will be considered.
In literature this system is usually referred to as circular coutte flow (CCF) \citep{Kundu2012}.

The problem can be reduced to polar coordinates $(r, \phi)$ and the equations of motion for the steady state are given by \citep{Kundu2012}
\begin{align}
    -\frac{u^2_\phi}{r} = - \frac{\partial p}{\partial r} \qquad ;& \qquad 0 = \frac{1}{Re}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r u_\phi)\right)
\end{align}

For the non-dimensionalization we choose the default convention, according to  \citep{Chen2015}
\begin{align}
    \text{Length:}\qquad &  \vec{r}^* = \frac{\vec{r}}{r_o - r_i}  &
    \qquad \text{Velocity:}\qquad& \vec{v}^* =  \frac{\vec{v}}{r_i\Omega_i}\\
    \text{Time:}  \qquad & t^* = t \cdot \frac{r_i \Omega_i}{r_o - r_i}&
    \qquad  \text{Pressure:}\qquad & p^* = \frac{\nabla p_\infty}{r_i^2\Omega_i^2}
\end{align}


The flow is then characterized by the Reynolds number $Re = \nicefrac{\Omega R_1d}{\nu}$. Integrating the equations twice leads to the solution (CITE)
\begin{align}
    u_\phi = Ar + \frac{B}{r}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
    A = \frac{-\Omega_iR_i^2}{R^2_o - R^2_i} ; B = \frac{\Omega_iR^2_i R^2_o}{R^2_o - R^2_i}
\end{align}

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Grid Convergence Study with comparsion to the Theoretical Solution}

The results of the grid convergence study are shown from Fig. () to Fig.().
For a better overview the results are distributed into four plots.
%The first plot shows the error of the Volumen-Penalization method,
%the second plot shows the error of the Direct-Forcing,
%the third plot shows the error of the Interpolation method and
%finally the fourth plot shows the methods with the smallest $l_2$-error
%for each method in comparsion.

In Fig. (X) the relative $l_2$-error is shown for the volume penalization method with and without the volume fraction method
for 2nd and 4th order.

For all methods an approximately linear decrease  can be observed.

The error of volume penalizations methods decrease from the order $1e-1$ to $2e-3$, with
a convergence rate of order  $\epsilon \propto N^{\approx1.16}$

The volume fraction methods results in a slighty better convergence rate of $\approx 1.65$.
The overall error is smaller, due to the faster converge rates and of order $5e-4$ for the

highest resolution. For all methods the error is in the order of $1e-2$, above a resolution of 100 points.
The best results are achieved for the 2nd order volume fraction method, except for the highest resolution.

Fig. () shows the error of the Direct Forcing method with and without the volume fraction method for 2nd
and 4th order. The error convergence is almost identical to the volume penalization method, when not using the volume
fraction method, of the order $\approx 1.2$. The convergence of the volume fraction methods is of order $\approx 1.45$
and therefore slighly weaker the for the volume penalization method.
As before the best error convergence is given by the volume fraction methond of 2nd order.

In Fig. (X) we can see the error convergence of the interpolation schemes.
Here we used 2nd and 4th order schemes, furthermore we compare the interpolation with and without the
use of the direct forcing method thus setting the velocity zero .

The 4th order interpolation with direct forcing is not shown, since the resulting velocity fields are becoming
numerically unstable. The 4th order interpolation without DF also results into a larger error but in this case
the velocity field seems to be stable the

convergence rate is of order $\approx 1.4$ and the error in the regime $1e-1$ to $4e-3$.
The best and furthermore identical results are achieved for the 2nd order interpolation with and without
use of the direct forcing method. The convergence rate is of order $\approx 2.35$ and the error
decreases from the order $2e-2$ to $1e-5$.

Finally Fig. () shows the previous methods with the best convergence rates in one plot.
In summary we can say that the overall converges rate of the interpolation method is of one order better
than the volume and direct forcing methods with volume fraction. Furthermore the relative error of the interpolation method ranges
between one and two order of magnitudes below all other methods, depending on the resolution.

\subsection{Discussion}


\section{Summary}
hpflow:
- die flow problems die wir hier haben sind nicht so komplex ndaher
vllt die bessere konvergenz
- oscilllation abklÃ¤ren -> rhie chow -> outlook
- interpolation fehler -> was soll man sagen
- alle methoden except ip haben gleiche fehler ordnung
- fraction methdos is a little bit better
- ip ist am besten mit 2 ordnung
-the best error is interpolation
