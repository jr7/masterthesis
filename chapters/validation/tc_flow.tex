The setup of the Taylor-Couette flow test case is shown in Fig. \ref{validation:setup_tcflow}.
It contains of two coaxial cylinders which are oriented parallel to the z-axis.
The inner cylinder has a radius and angular velocity $r_i$ and $\Omega_i$, in analogy we define
$r_o$ and $\Omega_o$ for the outer cylinder.
The fluid domain is given by the gap of width $d = r_o - r_i$ between the cylinder and extends to infinite.
For the simulation  periodic boundaries are used in $z$-direction.

In constrast to the previously examined test cases this system provides different characteristics
of the flow regime at the immersed boundaries. The flow along the boundary is not orthogonal to the curvature of the geometry,
Furthermore the velocity at the boundarys is not zero, the boundarie needs to fullfill the Dirichlet condition, which is given by
$|\vec{v}(\vec{r})|_{r_i} | = |\Omega_i \times \vec{r}|$.

In dependency of the domain paratemers different flow regimes can occur.
For small differences in the rotation rate the flow is laminar and azimuthal.
An increase of the angular velocity of the inner cylinder leads to an instability.
In this flow regime toroidally vortices form, which are also denoted as Taylor cells,
the flow is not pure azimuthal \citep{tritton88}.
In this testcase only the laminar and azimuthal flow regime, where the outer cyinder is not rotating ($\Omega_o = 0$), will be considered.
In literature this system is usually referred to as circular coutte flow (CCF) \citep{Kundu2012}.

The problem can be reduced to polar coordinates $(r, \phi)$ and the equations of motion for the steady state are given by \citep{Kundu2012}
\begin{align}
    \label{vali:tc_flow_eqnavstok}
    -\frac{u^2_\phi}{r} = - \frac{\partial p}{\partial r} \qquad ;& \qquad 0 = \frac{1}{Re}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r u_\phi)\right)
\end{align}

\clearpage

For the non-dimensionalization we choose the default convention, according to  \citep{Chen2015}
\begin{align}
    \text{Length:}\qquad &  \vec{r}^* = \frac{\vec{r}}{r_o - r_i}  &
    \qquad \text{Velocity:}\qquad& \vec{v}^* =  \frac{\vec{v}}{r_i\Omega_i}\\
    \text{Time:}  \qquad & t^* = t \cdot \frac{r_i \Omega_i}{r_o - r_i}&
    \qquad  \text{Pressure:}\qquad & p^* = \frac{\nabla p_\infty}{r_i^2\Omega_i^2}
\end{align}


The flow is then characterized by the Reynolds number $Re = \nicefrac{\Omega R_1d}{\nu}$.
With the integration of Eq. \ref{vali:tc_flow_eqnavstok}, according to \citep{Kundu2012}, the solution is given by
\begin{align}
    u_\phi = Ar + \frac{B}{r}
\end{align}
where $A$ and $B$ are defined as
\begin{align}
    A := \frac{-\Omega_i r_i^2}{r^2_o - r^2_i} \qquad ;& \qquad B := \frac{\Omega_i r^2_i r^2_o}{r^2_o - r^2_i}
\end{align}

\subsection{Simulations}


The simulations for this testcase were carried out in analogy to the Hagen-Poiseuill flow, see Sec. \ref{vali:hpflow_simsetups}.
Here the resolution is varied on the $x$ and $y$ axis, the radii are set to $r_i=1$ and $r_o=2$ and $l_x=l_y=2.5$.
The main parameters of the grid convergence study simulation are  given by

\begin{center}
\vspace*{0.7ex}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c }
 $ N  $                   & $\Delta t$ & $\Delta z$            & $\Rey$  & $c^2$   & $l_x, l_y$ & $r_o, r_i$ & $T_{end}$\\
\hline
 $512, [16, 256], \Delta N = 16 $& $10^{-4}$ & $\nicefrac{1}{N}$ & 500     & $500$   & (2.5, 2.5) & (2, 1)     & 20\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Grid Convergence Study with comparsion to the Theoretical Solution}


The results of the grid convergence study are shown from Fig. \ref{vali:tc_flow_gc_vp} to Fig. \ref{vali:tc_flow_gc_all}.
For a better overview the results are distributed into four plots.

In Fig. \ref{vali:tc_flow_gc_vp} the relative $l_2$-error is shown for different VP-methods.
For the VP-FD2 method the error convergence rate is about $\lambda=1.07$,
for the VP-FD4 method about $\lambda=1.16$, however it can be seen that the convergence decreases above $N\approx100$.
In this interall the error of the VP-FD4 method remains approximately constant.
The VF methods have a larger error (about $5\cdot 10^-2$ for $N=100$) in comparsion the VP methods
(between $10^{-2}$ and $2\cdot10^{-2}$.
In contrast a higher converges (about $\lambda=1.3$) can be observed for both, the FD2 and the FD4 method.

In Fig. \ref{vali:tc_flow_gc_df} the relative $l_2$-error is shown for different DF-methods.
For all methods the error convergence rate is about first order, except the DF-FD4 method which is about $\lambda=0.9$.
The smallest error is given by the DF-FD2 method which is about $\approx 2 \cdot 10^{-2}$ for $N=100$.
THis is about half an order smaller compared to the other methods.

In Fig. \ref{vali:tc_flow_gc_ip} the relative $l_2$-error is shown for different IP-methods.
For the IP-FD4 method the decay rate is about $1.47$.
For the IP-FD2 and IP+DF-FD2 method the errors are nearly  identical, the decay rate is about $1.09$
The IP+DF-FD4 method is numerically not stable and therefore not shown.
From the interpolation methods the IP-o4 method gives the smallest error for $N>100$ which is of order $10 \cdot 10^{-3}$.
Again it can be seen that the convergence decreases above $N\approx100$ for all methods.

Finally Fig. \ref{vali:tc_flow_gc_all} shows the methods  with the best convergence
rates from the different DF, VP and IP methods in one plot.
It can be noted that in this validation not alle errors are decreasing linear.
The best results are given by the interpolation methods, with small differences in the overall error
and convergence rate.

%For all methods, except IP+DF-FD4) an approximately linear decrease in the double logarithmic space can be observed.
%In summary it can be said that the overall convergence rate of the IP-FD2-method is of one order better
%than the VP-VF and DF-VF methods. The relative error of the interpolation method ranges
%between one and two order of magnitudes below all other methods, depending on the resolution.

\subsection{Discussion}


\section{Summary}
hpflow:
- die flow problems die wir hier haben sind nicht so komplex ndaher
vllt die bessere konvergenz
- oscilllation abklÃ¤ren -> rhie chow -> outlook
- interpolation fehler -> was soll man sagen
- alle methoden except ip haben gleiche fehler ordnung
- fraction methdos is a little bit better
- ip ist am besten mit 2 ordnung
-the best error is interpolation
