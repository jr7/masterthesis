\chapter{Python Simulation API}

\section{Introduction}

In this chapter a brief overview will be given to the high object oriented simulation API which
was written in the context of this thesis, with the python programming language.
The purpose of the library in general is to simplify the execution of simulations but furthermore
includes the possibility to analyse the results and use visualization techniques to study the overall
behavior of the simulations during runtime.
At first some of the  different API classes and objects will be introduced,
followed by a small application in form of a grid convergence study.

\section{Parameter File}

The Parameter file contains every flag and parameter which is used during the runtime of the simulation.
During compile time all parameters are converted into a specific set of C-macros which are then compiled
into the CUDA code. As a file format the open-standard format \textbf{Json} \footnote{Javascript Object Notation} is used.
An example of a Parameter file is shown in Listing \ref{lst_json}, it contains of two sections:

\begin{description}
\item[Conditions] Flags which are set to a constant value during runtime mostly zero or one. For example the boundary conditions and
                  interpolation methods. Not all flags have to be set for a simulation.
\item[Parameters] This set defines all parameters which are used  for a simulation. In contrast to the conditions each
                  parameter has to be defined in order to enable a proper execution.
\end{description}

    }
}

\section{Generator Class}

The generator class is responsible for the generation of all initial data.
This means the initial conditions for all variables i.e. velocity, temperature
and the computation of interpolation and domain masks which are necessary for the different
IB methods.\\
During the execution of a simulation all precomputed arrays are stored within a
HDF5-File format, which is optimized for the storage and structuring of large amounts of data.
Furthermore, the format simplifies the data exchange between the python API and the CUDA program.

For the generation of data a generator object has to be initialized with a generator function,
there are currently implemented two different types of these functions.

\begin{description}
\item[Initial  Conditions] These functions simply generate the initial conditions for a certain flow problem, for example the Taylor-Couette
                            flow or a simple cylindric domain. The definition of the functions can be found in \textbf{pycurb.ic}.
\item[Testcase] The test case functions extend the initial conditions the possibility to add certain forcing parameters into the time step
                for example a pressure gradient is necessary for the Poiseuille flow test case described in Sec. \ref{vali:sec_lpflow_setup}
                All defined functions can be found in \textbf{pycurb.testcase}.
\end{description}


\begin{python} [caption='Generator class usage', label={gen_class_usage}]
import pycurb as pc #import the simulation API
import pycurb.testcase as tf #import test cases
import pycurb.ic as as ic    #import initial conditions

#create a generator object for hagen poiseuille flow in z direction
generator = pc.Generator.from_testcase(tf.cylinder_flow_z)
#set the default velocity profile, pressure gradient and radius
generator.add_option('SETV', True)
generator.add_option('PMAX', pmax)
generator.add_option('r', 1.)

#create a generator object for taylor couette flow
generator = pc.Generator.from_ic(ic.taylor_couette)
#set velocity, inner and outer radius
generator.add_option('SETV', True)
generator.add_option('ri', ri)
generator.add_option('ro', ro)
\end{python}

Additionally it is possible to create a generator which takes the data from an old simulation. In listing \ref{gen_class_usage} the creation of a generator object is
exemplary shown. In a first step the generator is created by using a generator function. In the next step it is possible to define certain attributes
for example the radius of a cylindric fluid domain.

\section{Simulation Class}

An instance of the simulation class is the main object of the API and
necessary to execute a simulation. For the creation of a simulation object
the initial arguments are the file path, where all simulation data will be stored
and the json-file for the parameter setting.
Following the creation of the simulation object it is possible to alter all parameters and conditions
which were previously stored in the json-file. This gives the possibility to create
simulations with different parameter settings on the fly, i.e. changing the resolution of the numerical grid
to perform a grid convergence study.
Before the execution of the CUDA code, the simulation object has to be bind to a generator object
with the \textbf{generate\_files} class function, in return the generator object will begin
with the data creation. The last step is the execution of the CUDA code which can be done with the \textbf{start\_simulation}
class function.  A minimal use case of the complete procedure is shown in listing \ref{gen_usage_nextone}.

\clearpage

\begin{python}[caption='Simulation class usage', label={gen_usage_nextone}]
import pycurb as pc
import pycurb.ic as ic

#create a generator
generator = pc.Generator.from_ic(ic.taylor_couette)
#create a simulation object
sim = pc.Simulation('data', 'parameter.json')
sim.parameter.set('NX', 128)
sim.parameter.set('NY', 128)
sim.parameter.set_condition('o2', order)
sim.generate_files(generator)
#start the simulation
sim.start_simulation()
\end{python}

\section{Usage Example}

Finally a usage example for a grid convergence study using the Simulation API is given.
The source code is shown in listing \ref{gcstudy_papi}.
In the example  a Hagen-Poiseuille flow is simulated (see Sec. \ref{vali:section_hpflow_start}).

As first step all modules from the API are imported and all relevant constants are defined, for example the
Reynolds number is set to  $Re=100$.
In the next step a  for-loop iterates over the  array which contains all resolutions for which the
simulation should be executed.

Inside the for-loop the first step is to set a unique simulation path for each resolution.
Next, a generator with the pipe-flow settings from the \textbf{pycurb.testcase} module is created
and the options for the pressure gradient, the initial velocity field and the pipe radius are set.

Finally the simulation object is created. All parameters like resolution and domain size,
the order of the finite difference scheme and the direct forcing method are set.
The last step is the execution of a simulation.\\
%The given example is build to be executed on a single machine in order to further parallize the computations on
%more than one gpu an additional python script \textbf{worker.py} was written which is not yet included in the simulation API (see Appendix A(XX)).
%To parallelize the example some small adaptions has to be made. For each resolution the simulation path has to be stored into a textfile, which
%is than opened by the python script, furthermore the execution of the simulation has to be removed from the for-loop.
%Finally we start by generating all simulation data by executing the modified version of our script. Afterwards we start
%the parallelization script for which we have to specify the file including the simulation path and the number of gpus and cuda machines we want to use.

%The script creates a thread-safe queue and a number of threads, one for each gpu per machine.
%Each thread automatically fetches a job from the queue, than logs into the assigned cuda machine
%and executes the job on the given gpu.
%For time consuming simulations also a modificated version of the script was written where one thread
%can use more than one gpu, see Appendix A(XX).
