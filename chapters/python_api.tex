\chapter{Python Simulation API}

\section{Introduction}

In this chapter we want to give a brief overview to the high object oriented simulation API which
was written in the context of this thesis, with the python programming language.
The purpose of the library in general is to simplify the execution of simulations, but furthermore
includes the possibility to analyse the results and use visualization techniques to study the overall
behaviour of the simulations during runtime.\\
