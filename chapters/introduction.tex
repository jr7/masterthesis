Fluid flows play an important role in the study of geophysical systems.
Of particular interest are the flows on large scales in the ocean and the atmosphere.
Furthermore rotating and convection driven flows in the core of the earth are a potential mechanism
for magnetic field generation and current interest of research.

The flow in rotating fluids exhibits characteristic properties, as a result of the Coriolis force
physical solutions are of the form of inertial waves.
Numerical \citep{Sauret2012}, \citep{Duguet} and experimental
studies \citep{Fultz1959} of inertial waves excitation in rotating cylinders have been performed.
Inertial oscillations in spherical shells were investigated for example by \citep{Tilgner1999}.
%A further extension of the rotating fluids system by a coupling to magnetic fields
%The study of geo dynamos is possible by an extension of
%the rotating fluids system with a coupling to magnetic fields
The study of dynamos, i.e. the magnetic field of the earth, is obtained by additionally
considering an electrically conducting fluid.
Numerical simulations of precession driven dynamos \citep{Tilgner2005}
and convection driven dynamos \citep{Tilgner2012} were performed, furthermore
an on going experimental research project is the DRESDYN dynamo \citep{Stefani2015}.

In the fluid dynamics research group of the institute for geophysics
a recent development is the numerical simulation of such fluid flows using GPU optimized algorithms.
The use of GPUs for scientific computing has become increasingly popular in the last years.
A vast number of applications  can obtain a massive speed-up and
high oriented frameworks like the NVIDIA CUDA API simplify the creation
and maintenance of parallelized algorithms.
The current GPU implementation of the algorithm used in the research group is restricted
to simulations in cuboid domains.
Since an equidistant cartesian grid is used for the discretization of the fluid
domain it is not possible to perform simulations in complex-shaped geometries
because the boundaries of the fluid domain  do not coincide with the grid points.

The first goal of this master thesis is to extend the existing GPU algorithm
in order to enable the simulation of fluid flows in complex-shaped geometries.
The use of unstructured or body conforming grids is difficult to implement,
since on a GPU a regular and homogeneous memory access is required to enable a high memory bandwidth \citep{CUDABP}.
Hence, the objective is to use a set of methods which retain the speed of the original GPU algorithm and use a cartesian grid.

This requirement is fulfilled by Immersed Boundary methods, for which an
 overview of is given in \citep{Mittal2005}, \citep{Gornak2013}.
The concept behind these methods is the embedding of the curved boundary into the cartesian grid
by using additional forcing terms and interpolation methods close to the fluid boundaries.
Certain Immersed Boundary methods use a continuous forcing approach where the boundary is approximated by Lagrangian points
and the forcing term acts over multiple grid points \citep{Mittal2005},
similar approach is given by the Volume-Penalization method \citep{Lulff2011}.
Direct forcing approaches exist where the boundary conditions are obtained by setting the
velocity values directly at the nearest points to the boundary \citep{Fadlun2000}.
A bilinear interpolated version of the Direct Forcing approach is used in \citep{Gornak2013},
which was furthermore extended to work on a GPU \citep{DeLeon2012}.
In this thesis different Immersed Boundary methods will be introduced, implemented and
validated for different test cases.

The second goal of this master thesis is to perform a numerical study on a rotating fluid system.
In particular this system is given by a cone whose rotation rate is modulated which is used as a mechanism for inertial waves excitation.
An experimental study by  \citeauthor{Beardsley1970} \citep{Beardsley1970} of this system shows that the apex of the cone acts as an attractor,
inertial waves travel into the apex an dissipate at the tip of the cone.
By inserting a plate into the apex of the cone an inertial wave is reflected at the bottom and inertial modes are observable.
The objective of this part of the thesis is to investigate if these results
are reproducible with the use of an immersed boundary method.
