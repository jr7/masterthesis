Fluid flows play an important role in the study of geophysical systems.
Of particlar interest are the flows on large scales in the oceans
and the atmosphere and rotating and convection driven flows in the core of the earth, which are a potential mechanism
for magnetic field generation.

The flow in a rotating fluids exhibits characterics properties resulting from the coriolis force,
physical solutions are of the form of inertial waves.
Numerical \citep{Sauret2012}, \citep{Duguet} and experimental
studies \citep{QUOTE} of inertial waves excitation in rotating cylinders have been performed.
and Inertial oscillations in spherical shells were investigated in \citep{Tilgner1999}.
%A further extension of the rotating fluids system by a coupling to magnetic fields
%The study of geo dynamos is possible by an extension of
%the rotating fluids system with a coupling to magnetic fields
The study of dynamos, i.e. the magnetic field of the earth, is obtained by furthermore
considering an eletrically conducting fliud.
Numerical studies of precesseion driven dynamos can be found in \citep{Tilgner2005} and
rotating and convection driven dynamos were studied in \citep{Tilgner2012}.
An on going experimental research project is the DRESDYN dynamo \citep{Stefani2015}.

In the fluid dynamics research group of the institute for geophysics
a recent development is the numerical simulation of such fluid flows using GPU optimized algorithms.
The use of GPUs for scientific computing has become increasingly popular in the last years.
A vast number of applications  can obtain a massive speed-up and
high oriented frameworks like the NVIDIA CUDA API simplify the creation
and maintance of parallelized algorithms.
The current GPU implementation of the algorithm used in the research group is restricted
to simulations in cuboid domains.
Since an equidistant cartisian grid is used for the discretization of the simulation
domain it is not possible to perform simulations in complex-shaped geometries,
since the boundaries of the fluid domain  do not coincide with the grid points.

The first goal of this master thesis is to extend the existing GPU algorithm
in order to enable the simulation of fluid flows in complex-shaped geometries.
The use of unstructured or body conforming grids is difficult to implement,
since on a GPU a regular and homogenous memory access is required to enable a high memory bandwith \citep{CUDABP}.
Hence, the objective is to use a set of methods which retain the speed of the original GPU algorithm and use a cartesion grid.

This requirement is fulfilled by Immersed Boundary methods.
An overview of these methods is given in \citep{Mittal2005}, \citep{Gornak2013}.
The concept behind these methods is the embedding of the curved boundary into the cartesian grid
by using additional forcing terms and interpolation methods at the boundaries.
Certain Immersed Boundary methods use a continous forcing approach where the boundarie is approximated by lagrangian points,
and the forcing term acts over multiple grid points \citep{Mittal2005},
similiar approach is given by the Volume-Penaliztaion method \citep{Lulff2011}.
Direct forcing approaches exist where the boundary conditions are obtained by setting the
velocity values directly at the nearest points to the boundary \citep{Fadlun2000}.
A bilinear interpolated version of the Direct Forcing approach is used in \citep{Gornak2013},
which was furthermore extended to work on a GPU \citep{DeLeon2012}.
In this thesis different Immersed Boundary methods will be introduced, implemented and
validated by different test cases.

\bigbreak

The second goal of this master thesis is to perform a numerical study on a rotating system in order
to test the implemented methods on a physical more releveant example.

The system is given by a rotating cone whose rotation rate is modulated in order to excite inertial waves.
An experimental study of this system shows that the apex of the cone acts as an attractor to inertial waves.
By inserting a bottom plate into the cone  -> inertial modes

\citep{Beardsley1970}.
