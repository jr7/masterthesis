Fluid flows play an important role in the study of geophysical systems.
Of particlar interest are the flows on large scales in the oceans
and the atmosphere.
Rotating and convection driven flows in the core of the earth are a potential mechanism
for magnetic field generation, which is subject to current research.

The flow in a rotating fluids exhibits characterics properties resulting from the coriolis force,
physical solutions are of the form of inertial waves.
Numerical \citep{Sauret2012}, \citep{Duguet} and experimental studies \citep{QUOTE} of inertial waves in rotating cylinders were performed.
Inertial oscillations in spherical shells were investigated in \citep{Tilgner1999}.
A further extension of these fluids systems is given by a coupling to magnetic fields.
The resulting equations are used for the study of dynamos, i.e. the magnetic field of the earth.
Numerical studies of precession driven dynamos can be found in \citep{Tilgner2005},\citep{Tilgner2007a},
rotating and convection driven dynamos were studied in \citep{Tilgner2012}.
An on going experimental research project is the DRESDYN dynamo \citep{Stefani2015}.


In the fluid dynamics research group of the institute for geophysics
a recent development is the numerical simulation of such fluid flows using GPU optimized algorithms.

The use of GPUs for scientific computing has become increasingly popular in the last years.
A vast number of applications  can obtain a massive speed-up with the use of GPUs and
high oriented frameworks like the NVIDIA CUDA API simplify the creation
and maintance of parallelized algorithms.




-the algorithm problem

However, the parallelization of CFD algorithms can become a complex task.
On a GPU a regular and homogenous memory access is required to enable a high memory bandwith \citep{CUDABP}.
For curved geometries the numerical solution of CFD problems is often performed
on unstructured  or structured but body conforming grids \citep{Mittal2005}.
As a result the access to memory locations is heterogenous.
Adjacent memory cells are not accessed successively.


The current GPU implementation of the algorithm used in the research group is not suitable
for simulations in curved geometries.
The algorithm performs calculations on a cartesian grid and fluid flows can be simulated in a cuboid domain only.

The goal of this master thesis is to extend the existing GPU algorithm with the use of Immersed Boundary methods
in order to enable the simulation of flows in curved  geometries.
The methods will be implemented and tested for diffent validation test cases.
In the second part of the thesis the extended algorithm will be used for the simulation of a librating cone.
In this system inertial waves are excited by a modulation of the rotation rate.
An theoretical and experimantal studies are available for a comparison \citep{Sauret2012}, \citep{Beardsley1970}, \citep{Greenspan1969}.

-idea reflection and turbulence evtl dynamo studies


Immersed Boundary methods are a common approach to perform simulations of curved geometries, using cartesian grids.
An overview of these methods is given in \citep{Mittal2005}, \citep{Gornak2013}.
The concept behind this methods is the embedding of the curved boundary into the cartesian grid
by using additional forcing terms and intepolation methods at the boundaries.
Certain Immersed Boundary methods use a continous forcing approach where the boundarie is approximated by lagrangian points,
and the forcing term acts over multiple grid points \citep{Mittal2005}, a
similiar approach is given by the Volume-Penaliztaion method \citep{Lulff2011}.
Direct forcing approaches exist where the boundary conditions is obtained by setting the
velocities values directly at the nearest points to the boundary \citep{Fadlun2000}.
A bilinear interpolated version of the Direct Forcing approach is used in \citep{Gornak2013},
which was furthermore extended to work on a GPU \citep{DeLeon2012}.
