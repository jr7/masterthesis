\chapter{Inertial Waves in a Rotating Cone}

\section{Introduction}

Following the introduction and validation of the immersed boundary methods
we now want to exemplarly investigate a fluid system using these methods
and find out if we can reproduce some of the expected physical properties.
In relation to the research focus of the geophysical fluid mechanics research group, there are a variety
topics of interest.
One area of research lies in the exploration of dynamo effects in geological and stellar system.
In particular this means the generation of magnetic fields by electrically conducting fluids on large scales.
In this thesis we will not consider MHD-equations.
However in general it is considered that the helicity of a fluid domain $\Omega$, given by

\begin{align}
    \int_{\Omega}\dif V  \vec{u} \left( \nabla \times \vec{u} \right)
\end{align}

is directly linked to dynamo action \citep{moffat1978}.
Therefore it would be interesting to find a system which exhibits a large helicity,
as a possible candidate for future researches of the geo dynamo.
Furthermore we are interested in the propagation of inertial waves in different fluid domains.\\
The systems we want to study in this thesis is given by a librating cone, which is compared to
a librating frustum, by inserting a bottom plate into the apex.
Interial waves are excited by a temporal modulation of the rotation frequency.
The objective is to examine the ability to generate inertial modes or wave attractors.
Furthermore we want to study the properties of the helicity of the system and investigate the
decay of inertial oscillations.\\
In this chapter we will use linearized equations. Due to the axial symmetry with the rotating axis,
this problem could be reduced to two dimensions.
However, we want to test the code in a three dimensional setup.
One reason for this is a possible future application of the setup.
This objective would be to study the decay of turbulence in the apex of the cone,
a 3d simulation can not be avoided in this case.



\section{Inertial Waves in a Librating Cone}
\label{cone:theorie_exp}

\subsection{Theoretical Description}

We beginn with a short theoretical description of the problem adapted from \citep{Greenspan1969}, \citep{Beardsley1970}.
For the cone we make the comparsion to the two-dimensional case of a wedge.
This system is based on the idea to introduce a geometric shape, containing a singularity.
Here we want to discuss the propagation of an inertial wave emitting at one of the upper edges of
the wedge as shown in figure \ref{cone:theorie}.
The wave propagates under the angle $\theta = \arccos(\omega/2)$, with respect to the horizontal axis.
We consider an inviscous fluid.
For each reflection the propagation angle with respect to the rotation axis is preserved.
In the case of $\theta<\alpha$ we have a supercritical reflection,
thus a downward traveling wave ray is reflected downslope.

\begin{figure}[!bp]
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.6\textwidth}
      \centering
        \resizebox{0.7\textwidth}{!}{
       \import{gfx/cone//}{cone.pdf_tex}
      }
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.3\textwidth}
      \caption{
          Propagation of an inertial wave emitted from the top edge of a wedge,
           where $\Theta$ indicates the direction parallel to the group velocity
            $\vec{c_g}$, s $L$ and $L^{\prime}$ are the path lengths before and after a reflection.
      \label{cone:theorie}
      }
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

As a results the wave ray travels towards the lower vertex of the wegde.
It can be shown from the reflection properties given by equation () and (),
that the time for a wave ray to travel the path between two reflections is constant \citep{Beardsley1970},
which is

\begin{align}
    \frac{L}{|\vec{c}_g|} = \frac{L^{\prime}}{|\vec{c^{\prime}}_g|}
\end{align}

This means that the overall propagation time into the apex of the cone becomes infinity, along with the energy density and the wave number.
In conclusion it follows that since no reflection out of the cone apex can occur, the possibilty of inertial modes is not given.\\

\subsection{Experiment}

In order to test these theoretical assumptions  an experimental study was performed by \citep{Beardsley1970}.
The schematic setup of the experiment is shown in figure \ref{cone:setup_experiment}.\\
In the first part of the experiment a plexiglass cylinder, containing a conical shaped cavity,
of height $H=\SI{19.95}{\centi\meter}$ and a radius of $r=\SI{19.95}{\centi\meter}$ was used.
The apex half angle was set to $\alpha=24^{\circ}3.7^{\prime}$ degree.
For the rotation rate a frequency of $\omega =\SI{6.28}{\radian\per\second}$ was chosen.
As a fluid, water was used, the resulting viscosity, given by \citep{tipler2003}, is $\nu = \SI{1.0}{\milli\pascal\second}$.
The resulting Ekman number is

\begin{align}
    \Ekman = \frac{\nu}{\omega r H^2} \approx 7.72\cdot 10^{-6}
\end{align}

In order to exite inertial waves the cone is librating.
The total rotation rate is given by

\begin{align}
\Omega(t) = \Omega_0 + \epsilon \omega \cos(\omega t)
\end{align}

where $\omega$ is the libration frequency.
This means that excitation mechanism results from wall friction, induced
by a modulation of the constant rotation frequency $\Omega_0$.

\begin{figure}[!bt]
      \centering
        \resizebox{0.6\textwidth}{!}{
       \import{gfx/cone///}{experiment.pdf_tex}
      }
      \caption{
      experiment
      \label{cone:setup_experiment}
      }
\end{figure}

For the analysis the dynamic pressure field was measured at at different depths along the rotation axis,
with the libration frequency in the range of $0.25\leq\omega/2\Omega\leq2$.
The pressure and phase lag spectrum, for each measurement height, show that for this setup
no inertial modes can be observed.\\
In the second part of the experiment the apex of the cone was replaced by a frustum through the
insertion of a bottom plate in the cone, at the position $z/H = 0.261$.
With this setup yields the possibility that a wave ray can be reflected on bottom of frustum.
The pressure and phase lag spectrum in this setup show that
independent of the height resonances occur which can be associated with standing waves.
Hence inertial modes exist.

\section{Numerical Implementation of Libration}

For the numerical implementation of the experiment, we will use a modified set of the equations
introduced in section \ref{THEORIE:ROT}.
We have to concern that the system has now a time-depent rotation rate.
For the non-dimensional system, with $\vec{u}^* =  \vec{u} (|\vec{\Omega}|L)^{-1}$, we set

\begin{align}
    \vec{\Omega(t)} = 1 \; + \; \epsilon \cos(\omega t)\vec{e}_z
\end{align}

There are two options, which should be considered here.
First of all, we can choose a rotating coordinate system with a constant velocity $\Omega_0$.
This means the we can directly use the equations () to (). Since the overall rotation rate of the system is
modulated, it is necessary to introduce the boundary conditions

\begin{align}
    \vec{v}|_{Border}  = \Omega \times \vec{r} = \begin{pmatrix}
           -y \epsilon \cos(\omega t) \\
           x \epsilon \cos(\omega t) \\
           0\\
         \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

However, obtaining a linearized version of the boundary methods is not as easy.
In addition we think it is safer to use No-Slip boundaries with zero velocity, as
the taylor-couette system showed that other boundarie velocities can create a larger numerical error.
The alternative option is the introduction of an accelerated frame of reference.
In this case the boundary conditions do not need to be modified, but the coriolis forcing term is given by \citep{Tilgner2007}.

\begin{align}
    \vec{f} &= 2 \vec{\Omega} \times \vec{v} + \pdn[]{t}\left(\vec{\Omega} \times \vec{v} \right)
            = \begin{pmatrix}
           -y \omega \epsilon \cos(\omega t) \\
           -x \omega \epsilon \cos(\omega t) \\
           0\\
         \end{pmatrix}
            + 2\begin{pmatrix}
           - ( 1 + \epsilon \sin(\omega t)v_x \\
             ( 1 + \epsilon \sin(\omega t)v_y \\
           0\\
         \end{pmatrix}
            = \begin{pmatrix}
           -y \epsilon \cos(\omega t) \\
           -x \epsilon \cos(\omega t) \\
           0\\
         \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

In the last step the linearization was introduced.
Finally the non-linear advection term was removed from the equations of motion, which
are then given by

\begin{align}
    \label{theorie:rotns}
    \pdn[u]{t} = -c^2\nabla \rho + \Ekman \Delta \vec{u} + \vec{f} \qquad;& \qquad  \nabla \vec{v} = 0
\end{align}

Finally one additional stability criterion shall be introduced,
It is important that the time for propagting information from on side of the domain
to the other, is much smaller than the overall rotation rate.
\footnote{Private communication with A. Tilgner}
Since information inside the fluid domain propagates at an artificial sound speed,
this yields the estimation

\begin{align}
    t = \sqrt{\frac{2}{c^2}} << 2\pi
\end{align}

A good estimation is given by setting $c^2 = 500$.
It could be observed that otherwise, not only physical wrong results are obtained but also
numerical instabilitys can occur.

This convention will be used throughout rest of this chapter.
For the implementation the testcase function template introduced in chapter () is used.
The use of the different parameters with this template is shown in Appendix ().

\section{Data Analysis}

The main interest, in the analysis of the simulation data, lies in the identification of possible inertial modes.
A appropriate choice is to consider the energy in the $v_z$ velocity component of the intertial mode,
which is given by

\begin{align}
    \left<v_z^2 \right>(t) =  \int \dif V v_z(t)^2 \approx \sum_{i, j, k}^{N_x,N_y,N_z} \Delta x \Delta y \Delta z \left.v_z(t)^2 \right|_{i,j,k}
\end{align}

This has multiple benefits

\begin{itemize}
    \item The $v_z$-velocity component is indepent of the coordinate system which is used, it is not necessary
                to compute a transformation to inertial frame.
    \item The energy induced by the libration is perpendicular to this component, thus all components
            in the $v_z$-component are created by inertial  wave propagation(umshr)
\end{itemize}

In figure \ref{fig:cone:cyl_vzmode}, this energy is shown exemplarly for two libration frequencies for a cylinder.
\footnote{From section so und so}
For a resonance of the system ($\omega=1.2$) it takes further time until a steady state, with a constant oscillation is reachd.

\begin{figure}[!pb]
  \includegraphics{gfx/cone/cylinder/cyl_vz.pdf}\label{fig:cone:cyl_vzmode}
  \caption{Kinetic energy in $z$-direction for the direct forcing second-method and $\omega=1.2$.}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

In order to obtain a spectrum, the energy amplitude is computed from the last two extrem of $<v_z^2>$.
\begin{align}
    A\left(\left<v_z^2\right>\right) = \frac{\max(\argmax(\left<v_z^2\right>_{v})) - \max(\argmin(\left<v_z^2\right>_{v}))}{2}
\end{align}

We estimate the error of this method of order $\sigma 5-10A$.(Wie schreiben?)
For resonances the error is more likely to be in the range of 10 \% for non 5\%.
This can also be seen in figure ().\\
Secondly we want to compute the helicity of the system.
Here we use the normalized helicity, given my  \citep{XXX}

\begin{align}
H(t) = \frac{\int_V \dif V \vec{v} (\nabla \times \vec{v})}{\int_V \dif V |\vec{v}||\nabla \times \vec{v}|}
 = \frac{\sum_{i,j,k=0}^{N_x, N_y, N_z} \vec{v}_{i,j,k} (\nabla \times \vec{v}_{i, j, k})}
 {\sum_{i,j,k=0}^{N_x, N_y, N_z}|\vec{v}_{i,j,k}|| \nabla \times \vec{v}_{i, j, k}|}
\end{align}

The discretization of the rotation operator is using a central difference of second order.



\section{Simulation of a Librating Cylinder}
\label{cone:sec:lib_cylinder}

As a first step towards the implemenation of the librating cone,
simulations of fluid flow in a librating cylinder were carried out.
Despite the the theoretical and experimental results, discussed in section \ref{cone:theorie_exp},
it is diffult to find results in literature which would be suitable for an appropiate validation for the cone.
For the cylinder on the other hand, theoretical and numerical results are available.\\

\subsection{Setup}

The simulations were performed for all immersed boundary methods introduced in chapter \ref{IBM}.
Due to a misunterstanding the aspect ratio of the cylinder was set to $\Gamma=r/H=\nicefrac{0.5}{1.1}$ instead of $\frac{1}{2}$.
The main simulation parameters are given by

\subsection{Results}
\subsubsection{Inertial Wave Spectrum}

For all simulations, the kinetic energy of the $v_z$ velocity component was computed.
The results for the computation of the amplitude $A\left(\left<v_z^3\right>\right)$, in dependcy of the libration
frequency are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cone:cyl}.
All methods which were used show a similar profile.
The largest amplitude deviations can be spotted at a frequency of $\omega=0.8$ and are of the order $\approx2\cdot10^{-3}$.\\
It can be noted that a large resonance  occurs at the position $\omega=1.2$ of the order $\approx3.5\cdot10^{-2}$, followed by two
smaller resonances at $\omega=0.75$ and $\omega\approx1.7$ of order $\approx1.3\cdot10^{-2}$.
To make the deviations between the methods more visible, two inset plots are shown
set to the location $\omega=0.8$ and $\omega=1.0$.\\
For both positions, the largest amplitude is given by the direct forcing method of second order, followed by
the volume penalization method of second and fourth order.
The amplitude difference betweens the first two methods is just slighty visible when looking at the right inset plot.
It seems like these three methods yield nearly the same results for alle frequencies.
For all remaining methods  no strict order or grouping can be recognized.\\
The results for the interpolation method are not plotted in this spectrum, since the simulations became numerically unstable.

\subsubsection{Eigenvalues for the inviscid equations}

For a comparison to the theoretical solution introduced in section \ref{numerik:rotatingoderso}
the eigenvalues for the (n, m)-inertial modes with $n\in[1,6]$ and $m\in[1, 2]$ were  computed.
The results are shown in table \ref{cone_cyleigenvalues}.
There are four possible canditates,  which could correspond to the peaks in the spectrum.
The largest peak at $\omega=1.2$ is close to the eigenvalues of the (1, 2) and (2, 4) mode.
The left peak at $\omega=0.75$ could be the (2, 2) mode,
whereas the peak on the right side at $\omega=1.7$ is close to the eigenvalue of teh (1, 4) mode (evlt. M1 M2 M3 defi).
The eigenvalues for even $n$ are not considered. Due to the libration mechanism only azimuthal velocity fields which are even,
in relation to the plane $z=H/2$ are possible \citep{Sauret2012}.
Furthermore we are not considering modes with $m\geq2$. These modes are allready not visible at an Ekman number of $5\cdot10^{-5}$,
due to viscous damping of large wavenumbers \citep{Sauret2012} .

\subsubsection{Helicity}

The computation of the helicity was splitted into an integral over the upper and lower half
of the cylinder.  A result for $\omega=1.5$ is exemplarly shown in figure \ref{cone:cyl_helicity}.
In the upper half of the cylinder a negative helicity can observed, the maximum of the amplitude is of order $10^{-1}$.

      }
\end{figure}
\clearpage

In the lower half of the cylinder a positive helicity can observed, the maximum is of the same order as before.
The helicities are symmetric with respect to zero, thus $H_{\text{up.}} = -H_{\text{low.}}$.
As a result, it can be noted that the total helicity of the cylinder evaluates to zero for all times.

\subsubsection{Numerical Oscillations}

For all immersed boundary methods numericall oscillations are observable.
Figure \ref{cone:cyl_oscillations} shows this for the 2nd and 4th order direct forcing method and $\omega=1.5$.
The profile is taken along the $z$-Axis at $(x,y)=(\nicefrac{1}{2},\nicefrac{1}{2})$.
It can be noted that the error is larger in the regions near to the wall.
One important detail is that the oscillations are only observable in $z$-Direction not
in th $(x,y)$ plane.
For the 4th order method an upwinding scheme has been used. In comparison to the second order FTCS-Scheme,
it is visible that the oscillations are slightly dimished.

\subsubsection{Numerical Viscosity}

\subsection{Discussion}

\subsubsection{Immersed Boundary Methods o Spectrum}

The different immersed boundary methods show similar results in the profile of the amplitudes.
This in agrement with the results of validation testcases of the hagen-poiseuille and
taylor-couette flow, since the discretzation error of the boundaries is roughly of the same order of $\approx?$ (HMM..).
The results from this simulation are not useable for an error estimation however it can be noted

\section{Simulation of a Librating Cone}

In this section we will discuss the different numerical simulations, which has been performed
with a librating cone. We begin with the comparison to the experiment performed by \citep{Beardsley1970}.
As a next step we analyse the physical behaviour when performing the transition from a cylinder
to a cone and finally  we will investigate the influence of different offsets on top of the cone.
All simulations performed in this section use the introduced setup with different geometric parameters.
As a IBM we choose the direct forcing  method of second order.

\subsection{Simulation of the Experiment}

The setup for this simulation is oriented on the experimental setup given by \citep{Beardsley1970}, which
we disussed in section ().
In the first part of the experiment a plexiglass cylinder of height $H=\SI{19.95}{\centi\meter}$ and a radius of
$r=\SI{19.95}{\centi\meter}$ was used. The apex half angle was set to $24^{\circ}3.7^{\prime}$ degree,
which relates to our setup with $\alpha=65^{\circ}56.3^{\prime}$
For the rotation rate a frequency of $\omega =\SI{6.28}{\radian\per\second}$ was chosen.
As a fluid, water was used, the resulting viscosity,given by \citep{tipler2003}, is $\nu = \SI{1.0}{\milli\pascal\second}$.
The resulting Ekman number is given by

\begin{align}
    \Ekman = \frac{\nu}{\omega r H^2} \approx 7.72\cdot 10^{-6}
\end{align}

In the second part of the experiment the apex of the cone was replaced by a frustum through the
insertion of a bottom plate at the position $z/H = 0.261$.
For the simulation we choose an Ekman number of $\Ekman =  10^{-4}$, since a simulation of higher ekman numbers is
diffcult to realise due to the computational effort.
Furthermore we set $\alpha = \arccos(1/2) = 60^{\circ}$, $H=1$ and $r=0.5$.\\
This means that for $\omega=1$, the propagation of an inertial wave package is parallel to the slope of the cone.
For the offset on top of the cone, we obtain the condition

\begin{align}
    o = H - h_c =  1 - r\tan{\alpha} \approx 0.134
\end{align}

The simulation has two setups in analogy to the experiment.For the second part the bottom plate is set to $h_b=0.25$.
A series of simulations of these systems where performed, with the parameters

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Results \& Discussion}
\label{cone:exp}

The results of the simulations are shown in figure \ref{fig:cone_expseries}.
For both cases, the frustum and the cone, we can observe an increase in $A\left(\left<v^2_z\right>_V\right)$
from $\approx 2\cdot10^{-4}$ at $\omega=0$ to  $\approx 3.4\cdot10^{-4}$ for the frustum and $\approx 4\cdot10^{-4}$ for the cone,  at $\omega=1$.
From here one the Amplitude decreases to $\approx 5\cdot10^{-5}$ at $\omega=2$.\\
A difference between the two setups can be observed in the surrounding area of $\omega=1$.
For the cone the increase of the amplitude is interrupted at $\omega=0.6$, a minimum can be observed at $\omega=0.8$, followed by
a peak at $\omega=1$. For the frustum the minium is not directly visible but it can be noted that the
amplitude does not increase as much at $\omega=0.7$, as for lower frequencies.\\
The maximum occurs at $\omega=0.9$, in comparison to the cone we see an increase in the amplitude of $\approx 5\cdot10^{-5}$.
However, it has to be considered, that due do the stepwidth of $\Delta \omega = 0.1$, the exact position of the maxima is
not apparent.\\
One possible assumption, regarding the position of the maximum with respect to the frequency, is that
the expansion of the frustum with a tip  results in a shift to lower frequencies.
The left shift in the decrease for $\omega > 1$ furthermore supports this idea.\\
Overall it appears that the (spectrum) can be divided into two domains $\Omega_1~=~\{0\leq\omega<1$\} and $\Omega_2~=~\{1\leq\omega\leq2\}$.
This result is not unexpected, since we choose the slope $\alpha$ of the cone such that for $\omega=1$, it is parallel
do the group velocity $\vec{c}_{g}$.
For $\omega\in\Omega_1$ the results for both setups are similar, since in this domain, the cone tip does not act as an attractor.
An inertial wave propagates the top, after a reflection on the side of the cone.
Hence, for both setups we obtain a similar (spectrum).
The differences occur when $\omega$ is reaching the critical slope, in this scenario an inertial wave propating from the
top edges, travereses directly into the apex of the cone, or is reflected slightly at he bottom plate of the frustum.
As a results we see the increase in the amplitude.
For $\omega\in \Omega_2$ we would expect further reflections for the frustum, however the similar
decay of the amplitude refutes this assumption.\\
The results of the simulation do not match with the ones of the experiment we discussed in section ().
A possible explanation we want to propose here, is the use of a different Ekman number, which is of order $10^{-4}$ in contrast
to the one of the experiment of $10^{-5}$.
As a consequence the width of an inertial wave packet, given by $\propto \Ekman^{1/3} \approx 2\cdot10^{-2}$ (see \citep{} or section...),
is around twice the size as in the experiment. We assume that as a results a wave reflecting on the bottom of the frustum
is strongly damped due to wall friction.
DISCUSS T:\\
damping  could be propt $\Ekman \vec{K}$.

\subsection{Transition to from a Cylinder to a Cone}

We now want to further investigate the results from the previous simulation.
The assumption was made, that the inserted bottom plate is to narrow to support an efficient reflection
of inertial waves, due to frictional losses at the bottom of the cone. Thus, the next objective would be to
test the influence of different gap radii $r$.\\
We propose a setting where we begin with the possible largest bottom gap, which is $r=0.5$.
As a next step we iteratively decrease the size of the gap by $\Delta r = 0.125$ until $r=0$ is reached.
An alternative approach to this woudld be to change the offset from the bottom of the cone, which would result in a constant
slope but different heights of the simulation domain.
The influence on the simulation domain is shown in figure ()(b).
For $r=0.5$ the domain is given by a cylinder, which than transforms into a cone with a frustum and finally with an apex for $r=0$.
The main simulation parameters are given by

\subsubsection{Results \& Discussion}

The results of the simulations are shown in figure \ref{fig:cone:transition}.
For $r=0$ we can see the inertial modes of a librating cylinder, which is in accordance
to the results we discussed in section \ref{cone:sec:lib_cylinder}.
With an decrease of the radius we can observe a change in the position and amplitude of the
inertial modes. We want to exemplarly discuss this pattern for the (2, 2) mode at $\omega=1.3$, where it is the best visible.
For all other modes the transition results in a similar behvavior.\\

\begin{figure}[!pt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{gfx/cone/transition/transition.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:cone:transition}
    Simulation of
  }
\end{figure}

The decrease of the radius leads to a shift to lower frequencies of the (2, 2) mode,
from $r=0$ to $r=0.375$ it is of the order $\Delta \omega=0.1$.
Furthermore we can see, that during the transition a damping of the mode occurs.
For $r=0.5$ the amplitude is of order $\approx8.9\cdot10^{-3}$, for $r=0.375$ it is
$\approx8.9\cdot10^{-3}$ and for $r=0.25$ we obtain $\approx3.8\cdot10^{-3}$.\\
Whereas the first decrease of the radius does not significantly affect the amplitude,
the second decrease leads to a strong damping to less than half of the original size.
With a further decrease in $r$, the (2, 2) mode is annihilated.
\footnote{ for the possible (1, 2) mode we still can observe a slight increase of the amplitude at $r=1.4$}
One possible explanation for the shift can be given
by having a look at the inertial mode structure, for different radii as shown in figure \ref{fig:cone:phase}.\\
For $r=0.5$ we have an inertial mode, which is symmetric to the plane $h/2$.
In this plane, the waves excited from the bottom and top of the cylinder, annihilate each other and form a wave node.
An decrease of radius breaks the axial symetrie of the inertial mode.
As a result only a distorted version of the mode can exist, where the center of the wave node
is given by the intersection of the diagonals from the top to the bottom edges of the frustum.
In order to obtain the new shape it is necessary to increase the propagation angle $\Theta$,
which is equivalent to lowering the libration frequency.
We can furthermore say that for $r \rightarrow 0$, the center given by

\begin{align}
c  = r \frac{h}{r+\nicefrac{l_x}{2}}
\end{align}

converges against zero, hence a mode cannot exist in this state.
Beside the changes of the inertial modes it can be noted, that simultaneously to the decrease of the radius,
a lift of the amplitudes at lower frequencies occurs.
The vertical lines in figure \ref{fig:cone:transition} are set to the position $\omega=\Theta$.
The area $\omega<\Theta$ can again be associated with the frequency domain, where the wave propagation angle $\Theta$ is larger than
the  slope of the cone $\alpha$ and waves propgate to the top, up on reflection on the slope.
For $r=0$ we have the indentical setup to the simulation in section \ref{cone:exp}.

\subsection{Librating Cone with Differing Offsets at the Top}
\subsubsection{Introduction}

A a closure, this section represents the results computed with a new modified setup, which are more in accordance
with the experiment we introduced.
The improvements are based on the results and insights, which were gained from the previous simulations of the librating cone.
We want to adress the  most important points

\begin{itemize}
    \item The radius of the bottom plate of the frustum has a strong influence on
          the reflection of inertial waves.
          Due to the Ekman number of $\Ekman=10^{-4}$ we use, which is one order of magnitude
          above the experiment we assumed that a stronger damping acts on an inertial wave
          at the bottom plate.

    \item As a second point, we want to adress the influence of the offset on top of the cone,
          which has been left out from any discussion so far.
          It can be assumed this offset has a strong influence
          on inertial wave propagation.
          In particular for the intervall $\Theta<\alpha$, where wave super-critical reflection into the top corners occurs.
          In the case where $O=0$, the corners of the cone act as an attractor, as pointed out in figure \ref{cone:img_finalattractor}.
          For small gap sizes it applies that a inertial wave will be damped, in analogy to the bottom gap.
\end{itemize}

As a conlusion a larger gap radius $r$ for the bottom plate, will be introduced.
The exact influence of the offset is unknow, therefore we propose a series of simulations with different offsets.

\begin{figure}[!bp]
      \centering
        \resizebox{0.9\textwidth}{!}{
       \import{gfx/cone//}{comparison.pdf_tex}
      }
      \caption{

          an attractor for $o=0$ (right), in the upper edges of the cone.
      \label{cone:img_finalattractor}
      }
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Setup}

In this setup the radius $r$ is implitciy set by changing the height of the
bottom plate to $h_b=0.375$.  The resulting radius is $r \approx 0.22$.
This is done in order to maintain the constant slope of $\alpha=60$,
which is parallel to an inertial wave for $\omega=1$.
An additional offset is added to the default one,
varying in the range of $h_+ = [0, 0.5]$ with a stepsize of $\Delta h_+ = \nicefrac{1}{5}$.
The complete offset at the top is $O =  (\nicefrac{1}{2})\tan{\nicefrac{\pi}{3}}{2}+ h_+$.
The main simulation parameters are given by

\begin{center}
\vspace*{0.7ex}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c }
%\begin{tabular}{p{0.1\linewidth}| p{0.1\linewidth}| p{0.1\linewidth}|  p{0.1\linewidth}| p{0.1\linewidth}| p{0.1\linewidth} }
$\leftarrow h_+\rightarrow$ & $ \leftarrow  \omega \rightarrow $ & $\Delta t$ & $\Delta x$ & $c^2$ & \Ekman  & $l_x, l_y, l_z$ & $T^*_{end}$\\
\hline
$[0,\; 0.5], \Delta h_+ =0.125$ & $[0.2,\; 2], \Delta w = \nicefrac{1}{20}$ & $10^{-5}$ & $\nicefrac{1}{128}$ & 500 & $10^{-4}$  & (1, 1, $1+h_+$) & $\gtrsim100$\\
\end{tabular}
\vspace*{0.7ex}
\end{center}

It should be noted that a higher resolution for the frequency was used compared to the previous simulations.
The total simulation time $T^*_{end.}$ is marked as $\gtrsim 100$, here we want to introduce the modification

\begin{align}
    T_{\text{end.}}^* = \underbrace{\Bigl\lfloor\left(\text{T}_{\text{end}}\frac{\omega}{2\pi}\right)\Bigr\rfloor}_{
        \text{Floor}
        }\frac{2\pi}{\omega} + \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
\end{align}

As a consequence the endtime  of all frequencies, is set to the point where the librating force is crossing zero.
The scenario we want to study from there on is the decay of inertial waves.
To achieve this we continue a simlations with the previously computed endstates and set the libration amplitude $\epsilon$ to zero.
With the use of the modified endtime, we assume all that all intertial waves are
approximately in the same phase with respect to their libration frequency.
The simulation parameters changes according to

\subsection{Results}
\subsubsection{Spectrum for the Simulation with Different Offsets}

The results for this simulation are shown in figure \ref{fig:cone:finaltransition}.
On the left side of the plot  the frequency spectrum is shown, the right side illustrates the used geometry.
The height $h_+$ is in descending order, from top to bottom.
Each plot contains two spectra, one for the cone  and the other one for the frustum.
We beginn with a qualitative description of the curves for the frustum.\\
At all heights $h_+$, several resonance modes can be observed. For now we will consider the case where ${h_+=0.25}$.
For this height the largest peaks occur in the spectrum, which are numerated here in decreasing order of the amplitude.\\
The largest mode (\RN{1}) can be observed at a frequency $\omega=1.05$, the amplitude is of the order $5\cdot10^{-4}$.
The second mode (\RN{2}) can be found at $\omega=0.9$ of order $3.7\cdot10^{-4}$, followed by
a possible mode (\RN{3}) at $\omega=0.5$ of order $2.8\cdot10^{-4}$.
On the right side of the spectrum there are two possible small resonances at $\omega=1.7$ and $\omega=1.5$ (\RN{4}, \RN{5}).
For the case $h_+=0.5$  we can see small additional resonances  (\RN{6}) at $\omega=1.8$ and (\RN{7}) at $\omega=0.55$,
the latter is embedded in the slope of the (\RN{3}) mode.
For all peaks (except (\RN{7}), it can be noted, that a lowering of the offset height $h_+$ results
into a shift towards higher frequencies. This can be best seen when looking at the peaks (\RN{1}) and (\RN{2}).\\
Let us now consider the results of the cone.
Above the critical slope $\alpha=\theta$ nearly all resonances are eliminated. One exception is the (\RN{4}) mode for
$h_+=0.5$ and $h_+=0.375$. Another exepction is at the position of the previous (\RN{1}) mode of the frustum.
For $h_+=0.5$ (see \textbf{O}) a small increase in the amplitude can be observed.
On the left side of the critcal slope we can identfiy the (\RN{3})-peak
at the same frequency and same order as for the frustum. To the left side of this point the spectrum for
the cone and the frustum are similar.

Furthermore at the position of peak (\RN{2}) of the cone, we now see a slightly diminshed mode \RN{8}.
The maximum is at the same frequency at $h_+=0.5$ but diverges slightly with an decrease of the height $h_+$.\\
