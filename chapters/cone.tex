\chapter{Inertial Waves in a Rotating Cone}

\section{Introduction}

Following the introduction and validation of the immersed boundary methods for no-slip conditions,
we now want to exemplarly investigate a fluid system using these methods
and see if we can reproduce some of the expected physical properties.\\
In relation to the research focus of the geophysical fluid mechanics research group there are a variety
topics of interest.
One area of research lies in the exploration of dynamo effects in geological and stellar system.
In particular this means the generation of magnetic fields by electrically conducting fluids on large scales.
In this thesis we will not consider MHD-equations.
However in general it is considered that the helicity of a fluid, given by
\begin{align}
    v curl v
\end{align}
is directly linked to dynamo action [CITE].
Therefore, beside inertial wave propagation we want to observe a possible large helicity.
For the system we describe in the following section one further application
would be to study inertial wave excitaton by turbulence.

\section{Theoretical description}

The objective we have in mind is the numerical computation of inertial wave excitation inside a liberating cone.
The system was already investigated in an experimentally setup [CITE].
Here we want to give a brief overview of the theoretical properties and experimental results.\\
The schematic setup of the experiment is shown in figure ().
It contains of a cone given by the radius $R$ and the height $h$, resulting into an angle $\alpha = \tan()$.
The cone is rotating with a modulated frequency

\begin{figure}[!tbp]

  \caption{blabla}
\end{figure}

\begin{align}
\Omega(t) = \Omega_0 + \epsilon \omega \cos(\omega t)
\end{align}

The modulation of the rotation frequency is also denoted as libration [RIGHT?] and can be used as a possible mechanism
for inertial wave exitation [CITE].
The overall idea of the setup is to introduce a geometry containing a singularity and study the influence on the ability of
the system to develop inertial eigenmodes.
Let us recall that the dispersion relation and group velocity of an inertial wave paket is given by

\begin{align}
    \omega = \frac{2\vec{\Omega}\vec{K}}{K} = 2 \Omega \cos\Theta ; \vec{c}_g = -\frac{2\vec{K}\times (\vec{\Omega} \times \vec{K})}{K^3}
\end{align}

with the wavenumber $\vec{K}$.
Let us now consider the propagation of an interial wave paket from the top edge of the cone as shown.
As discussed in section (), the reflection of inertial waves up on a  plane wall is a violation of snell's law.
For each reflection the propagation angle with respect to the rotation axis stays constant,
whereas the group velocity decreases.
It can be shown that for all path i.e. $L$ and $L^o$ the propagation time of the wave energy stays constant [CITE]
\begin{align}
    \frac{K^o}{K} = \frac{\cos(\Theta - \alpha)}{\cos(\Theta + \alpha)}
\end{align}
This means that the overall propagation time into the apex of the cone becomes infinity, along with the energy density and the wave number.
In conclusion it follows that since no reflection out of the cone apex can occur, the possibilty of inertial eigenmodes is not given.\\
In the experimental setup described by [] and additional experiment was performed where the cone was replaced with a frustum of a cone,
thus a bottom blade to enable a reflection of inertial waves.
As a result for the cone with apex, a continuos wave spectrum could be observed.
When just using the frustum of a cone a discrete wave spectrum could be observed(BAD TO SHORT).\\
